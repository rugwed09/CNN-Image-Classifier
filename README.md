CNN Image Classifier

This repository contains a deep learning project that utilizes TensorFlow to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the purpose of image classification. The model is designed to classify images into different categories based on their features, which is useful in various applications like photo tagging, content filtering, and more.

Project Overview

	•	Objective: To develop a robust image classification model using CNNs that can accurately classify images into predefined categories.
	•	Technology Stack: TensorFlow, TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Matplotlib are used for creating, training, and evaluating the model.
	•	Dataset: The dataset consists of images from multiple classes, processed and used to train the CNN.

Key Features

	•	Image Processing: Includes preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the image data for training, such as removing corrupt images and normalizing image formats.
	•	Model Architecture: Utilizes a sequential CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers to perform the classification.
	•	Training and Validation: The model is trained and validated using a split of the data to ensure it generalizes well on unseen data.
	•	Performance Evaluation: Evaluates the model’s performance through metrics such as loss, accuracy, precision, and recall.
	•	Model Deployment: Includes instructions for saving and reloading the trained model, making it easy to deploy for new image classification tasks.

Usage
